### 2026-10-16 — Claude Code (development agent) — DOCS-003
- **Did:** Added interim proprietary `LICENSE` (all rights reserved) at the owner's
  request; updated LICENSE-DECISION.md, README status, task board, CHANGELOG. Set the
  GitHub repo description and topics. Corrected the INFRA-001 note below.
- **State of the code:** Still no application code.
- **Next steps:** Revisit the long-term license before the repo is made public.

### 2026-10-16 — Claude Code (development agent) — DOCS-001, INFRA-001
- **Did:** Completed Phase 0. Wrote docs 00–26, `architecture/`, `agents/`,
  `prompts/`, `planning/`, `decisions/` (template + ADRs 0001–0010, all
  *Proposed*), `research/`; READMEs for all eleven top-level code directories.
  Pushed to the private GitHub repo `adamissac/hackatl-agentic-security`, which
  had already been created with the base commit (`a59f0a8`) by the repository owner.
- **State of the code:** No application code exists. Only Markdown, repository
  config files and GitHub templates. Verified with a file listing of non-Markdown
  files.
- **Commands run:** internal Markdown link check (script, not committed) — all
  links resolve; secret-pattern scan over the tree — no matches beyond
  placeholders in `.env.example`.
- **Decisions:** All architecture choices recorded as *Proposed* ADRs pending
  team ratification (DOCS-002).
- **Assumptions:** Doc numbers 02, 03, 14, 18–22, 26 were not named by the
  original README/AGENTS/CLAUDE files; titles chosen from context (e.g. 14 = UX,
  18 = infrastructure per `.env.example`, 20 = demo, 26 = risks for architecture
  review). Demo target name `payments-lite` is a proposal.
- **Open questions:** RQ-011 (HackATL date/format), RQ-014 (team), and the rest
  of [RESEARCH_QUESTIONS](../research/RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md).
- **Next steps:** Human authorizes Phase 1; assign roles; ratify ADRs; start
  CORE-001, DEMO-001, RL-001, INFRA-003, INFRA-005 in parallel.
- **Warnings:** Do not start Phase 1 work without explicit authorization. CI
  link/secret checks are not automated yet (INFRA-003).


### 2026-10-17 — Sarosh implementation agent — INTEL-001..008, PR #6

- Implemented persistent SHA-pinned Python intelligence on `feat/sarosh/code-intelligence`.
  Git object reads never execute target code; include_prefix excludes labels/answer keys.
  Tree-sitter/AST structure, static graph confidence, route dependencies, extracted intent,
  optional bounded Claude inference, delimited context and symbol-span impact are implemented.
- Uses canonical shared models, SQLite local and backend-owned PostgreSQL PayloadStore.
  Real signed-webhook integration persisted symbol-level head impact.
- Executed: producer/PostgreSQL **22 passed, 1 opt-in skip**; broader shared/monitoring/backend/
  intelligence **105 passed, 4 skipped** (RL package, TypeScript compiler, two live suites).
  Ruff/format/strict mypy pass; 337 Markdown files checked, 0 link problems.
- Actual-target evidence and canonical ContextPack fixture are in `code-intelligence/evidence`
  and `code-intelligence/fixtures`; small labeled exact graph TP=3 FP=0 FN=0.
- Live attempt skipped because authorized key unavailable here. FakeTransport exercised the
  shared gateway, denied a shell tool and persisted low-confidence inference metadata.
- Next: sync latest main and final CI; Sai/Alan replace temporary runtime indexing with this
  service. Human decisions, promoted regression/finding joins, router composition and parse
  caching remain follow-ups. No full runtime or production claim. Unrelated untracked
  `.serena/` and nested checkout were left untouched.

- Sarosh final verification (2026-10-17T01:56Z): on main sync `4a8d692`, broader suite
  **113 passed, 4 skipped** with isolated TypeScript 5.6.3 compiler. Skips: RL-dependent
  collection/test and two live suites. Intelligence/store/webhook acceptance previously
  **22 passed, 1 skipped**; subsequent actual factory/exclusivity check passed. PR CI for
  pushed `87e898d`: both test jobs, links and gitleaks passed. Check latest PR #6 revision
  and consumer adapter messages before further integration.

- Sarosh final failure-path check (2026-10-17T01:59Z): producer/PostgreSQL/webhook suite
  **23 passed, 1 opt-in skip**; invalid commit/path ingestion returns terminal failed
  Snapshot for the backend to persist. Ruff/format/strict mypy pass. PR #6 carries final
  commits and CI status; live inference remains blocked on an authorized key.

- Sarosh ownership review fix (2026-10-17T02:03Z): route-specific ownership rules and
  sibling-call-site evidence now reach the vulnerable payment read; get_store is not auth.
  A two-commit actual-target test proves the possible-inconsistency warning disappears when
  require_owner is restored. Broader suite: **115 passed, 4 skipped**. Index version 0.2.0
  requires re-indexing old 0.1.0 payloads; all fact/source keys remain immutable. Updated
  producer evidence/context fixture have 49 expectations and a 23,267 / 24,000 pack.
