### 2026-10-16 — Claude Code (development agent) — DOCS-001, INFRA-001
- **Did:** Completed Phase 0. Wrote docs 00–26, `architecture/`, `agents/`,
  `prompts/`, `planning/`, `decisions/` (template + ADRs 0001–0010, all
  *Proposed*), `research/`; READMEs for all eleven top-level code directories.
  Created private GitHub repo `adamissac/hackatl-agentic-security` and pushed `main`.
- **State of the code:** No application code exists. Only Markdown, repository
  config files and GitHub templates. Verified with a file listing of non-Markdown
  files.
- **Commands run:** internal Markdown link check (script, not committed) — all
  links resolve; secret-pattern scan over the tree — no matches beyond
  placeholders in `.env.example`.
- **Decisions:** All architecture choices recorded as *Proposed* ADRs pending
  team ratification (DOCS-002).
- **Assumptions:** Doc numbers 02, 03, 14, 18–22, 26 were not named by the
  original README/AGENTS/CLAUDE files; titles chosen from context (e.g. 14 = UX,
  18 = infrastructure per `.env.example`, 20 = demo, 26 = risks for architecture
  review). Demo target name `payments-lite` is a proposal.
- **Open questions:** RQ-011 (HackATL date/format), RQ-014 (team), and the rest
  of [RESEARCH_QUESTIONS](../research/RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md).
- **Next steps:** Human authorizes Phase 1; assign roles; ratify ADRs; start
  CORE-001, DEMO-001, RL-001, INFRA-003, INFRA-005 in parallel.
- **Warnings:** Do not start Phase 1 work without explicit authorization. CI
  link/secret checks are not automated yet (INFRA-003).
